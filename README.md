# Word Embedding Project

This project contains code and resources for building and working with word embeddings.

## Files

- **vocab.txt**: Contains the vocabulary contained in the skip-gram model. Just for my own reference for which words to use.
- **normalize_text_module.py**: Python script for text normalization functions, such as lowercasing and removing special characters.
- **normalize_text_sentence_module.py**: Python script for sentence-level text normalization.
- **w_embeds.py**: Python script for handling word embeddings and performing other related tasks.
- **Report.pdf**: PDF report summarizing the project, methodologies used, and results obtained.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and its files.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the latest Python installed.
2. I haven't used any local files so no need for specific python versions.
